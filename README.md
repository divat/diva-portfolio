# Dhivakar — Software Engineer Portfolio

This is my collection of real-world, production-style projects built using Java, Spring Boot, OAuth/JWT, SQL, Docker, Kubernetes, and modern engineering practices.

Each project is designed to demonstrate:
- clean architecture & modular design  
- real API development workflow  
- authentication patterns (OAuth/JWT)  
- cloud-ready & container-ready setup  
- real work I can show to clients & interviewers
